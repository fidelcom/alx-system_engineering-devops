Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is a server
Where servers usually live
What is SSH
How to create an SSH RSA key pair
How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All your Bash script files must be executable
The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing
Your servers

Tasks
0. Use a private key
mandatory
Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/school with the user ubuntu.

Requirements:

Only use ssh single-character flags
You cannot use -l
You do not need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./0-use_a_private_key
ubuntu@server01:~$ exit
Connection to 8.8.8.8 closed.

1. Create an SSH key pair
mandatory
Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

Requirements:

Name of the created private key must be school
Number of bits in the created key to be created 4096
The created key must be protected by the passphrase betty
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ls
1-create_ssh_key_pair
sylvain@ubuntu$ ./1-create_ssh_key_pair
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Your identification has been saved in school.
Your public key has been saved in school.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
5d:a8:c1:f5:98:b6:e5:c0:9b:ee:02:c4:d4:01:f3:ba vagrant@ubuntu
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 4096]----+
|      oo...      |
|      .+.o =     |
|     o  + B +    |
|      o. = O     |
|     .. S = .    |
|      .. .       |
|      E.  .      |
|        ..       |

2. Client configuration file
mandatory
Your machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, let’s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

Requirements:

Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
Example:

sylvain@ubuntu$ ssh -v ubuntu@98.98.98.98
OpenSSH_6.6.1, OpenSSL 1.0.1f 6 Jan 2014
debug1: Reading configuration data /etc/ssh/ssh_config

debug1: Connecting to 98.98.98.98 port 22.
debug1: Connection established.
